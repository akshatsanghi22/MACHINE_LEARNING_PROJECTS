**Water treatment plan** : 
This dataset comes from the daily measures of sensors in an urban wastewater treatment plant. The
objecƟve is to classify the operaƟonal state of the plant in order to predict faults through the
state variables of the plant at each of the stages of the treatment process. There are 527 instances and 38
aƩributes, each row is for a single day. The first element of each line is the day of the data collecƟon, the
rest are the aƩribute values
The Goal is to idenƟfy the operaƟonal state of a plant using clustering algorithms.
