# MACHINE_LEARNING_PROJECTS
All the machine Learning projects 


# 1)Water treatment plan: 
This dataset comes from the daily measures of sensors in an urban wastewater treatment plant. The
objective is to classify the operaƟonal state of the plant in order to predict faults through the
state variables of the plant at each of the stages of the treatment process. There are 527 instances and 38
atributes, each row is for a single day. The first element of each line is the day of the data collecƟon, the
rest are the atribute values
The Goal is to idenƟfy the operaƟonal state of a plant using clustering algorithms.

#  2) Diabetic Patient:
This dataset comprises a rich set of over 50 features that capture various aspects of paƟent and hospital
outcomes. These data points were gathered based on specific encounter criteria:
Inpatient Encounters: The dataset exclusively focuses on hospital admissions, i.e., inpatient
encounters.
Diabetic Encounters: It includes encounters where any form of diabetes was recorded as a diagnosis.
Length of Stay: Encounters with a length of stay ranging from 1 to 14 days are included.
Laboratory Testing: Only encounters where laboratory tests were conducted during the stay are
considered.
Medication Administration: Encounters where medicaƟons were administered are part of the
dataset.
The Goal is to predict the target variable in AX column, whether the paƟent is readmiƩed in the hospital
again. The dataset is a highly imbalanced in nature


#  3) Criticial Temperature
There are two files:
(1) train.csv contains 81 features extracted from 21263 superconductors along with the criƟcal
temperature in the 82nd column
(2) unique_m.csv contains the chemical formula broken up for all the 21263 superconductors from the
train.csv file. The last two columns have the critical temperature and chemical formula.
The goal here is to predict the criƟcal temperature based on the features extracted.
